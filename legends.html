           <p class="drop">Sanborn's fire insurance enterprise produced not only excellent and detailed urban maps, but they also maintained an elegant aesthetic in the headings and legends on the maps themselves, and in the title pages of the (larger) city volumes. The ornamental flair is diverse -- I don't think any of the examples above repeat type styles -- and lends an air of individuality and refinement to each of the towns surveyed.</p> 
<p>Trying always to go forward, we forget what Amazing works, others did in the past. Every Monday, at B | Creative will be published some great ad collections from the past.Founded in 1866 by Daniel Alfred Sanborn, a surveyor from Massachusetts,Â The Sanborn Company began making fire insurance maps in 1867. The company first gained recognition for the rich detail employed in the maps they produced in the 1800s, and today these archived maps are still widely used for research purposes.Â Sanborn still exists as a mapping and GIS company.</p>
<p>Although this sort of artistic embellishment was unlikely to have increased map sales on its own, it's a charming addition which will have perhaps made the purchasers feel a sense of pride and a little more secure about their own unique town. And it's certainly in keeping with the cartographic tradition of decorative trimmings.</p>
