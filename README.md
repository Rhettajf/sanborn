Sanborn ITGM-715-OL Project A
Sanborn, a project for ITGM-715, is a site that will showcase typography and design from early works by the Sanborn Map Company. This is version v0.1, [the first prototype](http://itgm715.rhettforbes.com/projecta/sanborn). 
## Why?
Sanborn’s maps feature beautiful hand rendered letter forms that will inspire any typographer to put pen to paper. Their maps, especially the cover pages, are timeless examples of historical hand-drawn type design. Each cover features unique letter forms and endless typographic inspiration.
## How?
The awesome line work you see in Sanborn maps is difficult to replicate on screen. Imperfections make their maps perfect and in a pixel perfect medium, this is a challenge to achieve. All line work and borders use SVGs to keep things sharp and scalable. Thanks to Raphaël and DrawStates, I was able to write a responsive interactive map and begin to index the maps by state. I expanded upon Drawstates to include active and hover states, tooltips, and link the states to there pages.
