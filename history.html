                <h3>Sanborn Map Company</h3>
                <img src="img/hr3.svg" alt="header" class="hr"> 
                <p>The Sanborn Map Company is an American publisher of historical and current maps of US cities and towns.</p>
                <p>Arguably one of the most effective sources for traditional and public historians alike, Sanborn fire insurance maps offer unparalleled documentation of over a century of urban development and land use in the United States. The brainchild of the surveyor Daniel Alfred Sanborn, Sanborn fire insurance maps originated in 1867 as a means to establish insurance costs for protecting the burgeoning numbers of cities and towns against the threat of fire. </p>
                <p>In the Sanborn Map Company’s effort to reflect property values accurately, it established the first nationally standardized mapping techniques, which included documenting the location, use, and construction materials used in buildings in cities and towns across the country. Through its periodic resurveying of towns and cities, the Sanborn Map Company effectively tracked physical change over time, creating a gold mine of information important to historians, urban planners, geographers, architects, and others.</p>

                <h3>About the Maps</h3>
                <img src="img/hr3.svg" alt="header" class="hr"> 
                <p>Sanborn maps are large-scale lithographed street plans at a scale of 50 feet to one inch (1:600). They were presented on 21 by 25 inches sheets of paper. The maps were published in volumes. Larger cities would have multiple volumes. In between volumes, updates were created and sent out to be pasted on top of the old maps (referred to as ‘slips’) to preserve accuracy.</p>
                <p>The map volumes contain an enormous amount of information. They are organized as follows: a decorative title page; an index of streets and addresses; a ‘specials’ index with the names of churches, schools, businesses etc.; and a master index indicating the entirety of the mapped area and the sheet numbers for each large-scale map; and general information such as population, economy and prevailing wind direction. The maps include outlines of each building and outbuilding; the location of windows and doors; street names; street and sidewalk widths; property boundaries; fire walls; natural features (rivers, canals, etc.); railroad corridors; building use (sometimes even particular room uses); house and block number; as well as the composition of building materials including the framing, flooring, and roofing materials; the strength of the local fire department; indications of sprinkler systems; locations of fire hydrants; location of water and gas mains; and even the names of most public buildings, churches and businesses.</p>
